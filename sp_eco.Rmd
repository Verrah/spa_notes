* @lovelace2014introduction is a great introduction.
* Chapter 6 of @comber2015, in particular subsections 6.3 and 6.7.
* @bivand2013applied provides an in-depth treatment of spatial data in R.

# Dependencies

This tutorial relies on the following libraries that you will need to have installed on your machine to be able to interactively follow along^[You can install package `mypackage` by running the command `install.packages("mypackage")` on the R prompt or through the `Tools --> Install Packages...` menu in RStudio.]. Once installed, load them up with the following commands:

```{r}
# Layout
library(tufte)
# For pretty table
library(knitr)
# Spatial Data management
library(rgdal)
# Pretty graphics
library(ggplot2)
# Pretty maps
library(ggmap)
# Various GIS utilities
library(GISTools)
# For all your interpolation needs
library(gstat)
# For data manipulation
library(plyr)
```

Before we start any analysis, let us set the path to the directory where we are working. We can easily do that with `setwd()`. Please replace in the following line the path to the folder where you have placed this file -and where the `house_transactions` folder with the data lives.

```{r}
#setwd('/media/dani/baul/AAA/Documents/teaching/u-lvl/2016/envs453/code')
setwd('.')
```
